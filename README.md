## 1. Introduction to HTML
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web pages. It describes the structure of a webpage using markup.

## 2. Basic HTML Structure
A basic HTML document includes:
- `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration
- `<html>` element
- `<head>` element
- `<title>` element
- `<body>` element

## 3. Common HTML Tags
Some of the most commonly used HTML tags include:
- `<h1>` to `<h6>` for headings
- `<p>` for paragraphs
- `<a>` for hyperlinks
- `<div>` for divisions or sections
- `<span>` for inline sections

## 4. Attributes
HTML elements can have attributes that provide additional information. Common attributes include `id`, `class`, `src`, `href`, and `alt`.

## 5. Lists
HTML supports ordered (`<ol>`) and unordered (`<ul>`) lists, with list items defined using the `<li>` tag.

## 6. Links
Links are created using the `<a>` tag with the `href` attribute to specify the URL.

## 7. Images
Images are embedded using the `<img>` tag with the `src` attribute to specify the image source and `alt` attribute for alternative text.

## 8. Tables
Tables are created using the `<table>` tag, with rows defined by `<tr>`, headers by `<th>`, and data cells by `<td>`.

## 9. Forms
Forms are used to collect user input and are created using the `<form>` tag. Common form elements include `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`, and `<button>`.

## 10. Semantic HTML
Semantic HTML introduces meaning to the web page rather than just presentation. Examples include `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, and `<section>`.

Feel free to explore the code examples and practice the concepts to strengthen your understanding of HTML basics.
